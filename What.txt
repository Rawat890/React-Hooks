Hooks are new feature addition in react version 16.8 that allows us to use React features without writing the class

Hooks don't work inside the class

Why it is needed ? 
Reason1 - this keyword work in js
Remember to bind event handlers in class components
Reason2 - no particular way of reusing the stateful component logic
no sharing of stateful logic
Reason3 - Related code is not organized in one place
example -
Data fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
EventListeners - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
